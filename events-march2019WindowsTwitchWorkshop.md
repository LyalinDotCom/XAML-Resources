## Full Agenda - March 14th 2019

### 8AM - 9AM  | Lap Around Windows Developer XAML Tooling for WPF & UWP

Coming Soon

### 9AM – 10AM | Building Composite .NET Core 3.0 Applications with Prism 

In this session you will learn how to design and build Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) desktop applications using loosely coupled components that can evolve independently but which can be easily and seamlessly integrated into the overall application. This session concentrates on the basic concepts required to build a composite .NET Core 3 application with the Prism framework which includes the regions, modules, view composition, and different techniques for communicating between loosely couple components.  Various development patterns and technologies will also be discussed including Inversion of Control (IoC), Dependency Injection (DI), commanding, event aggregation, and MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel).

### 10AM – 11AM | Reactive MVVM on the .NET Platform

Tune in for a session with Geoff to learn about reactive programming that you can use with your next WPF or WinForms project. Reactive is a paradigm that allows you to express the idea around a feature in one readable place, abstract mutable state away from your user interfaces and improve the testability of your application.

### 11AM – 12PM | Porting WinForms and WPF applications to .NET Core 3.0

.NET Core 3 is coming and with it support for building WinForms and WPF applications for Windows Desktop. In this Twitch I will show on example how to port a WinForms\WPF application from .NET Framework to .NET Core. We'll cover reasons for porting, useful tools and best practices. I'll show how you can keep using the WinForms designer in Visual Studio even though it's not yet available for .NET Core projects.

### 12PM – 1PM | Modernizing your existing Windows Desktop UIs with XAML Islands

XAML Islands is the first big step toward a developer experience that will enable WinForms, WPF, and Native Win32 developers will be able to use all the innovation that Windows has done in the User Experience in the last years. With XAML Islands, developers can access the more capable, flexible, powerful UWP XAML controls regardless which UI stack they use. Windows Forms, WPF, or native Win32 developers will be able to create more productive and deeply engaging experiences with Microsoft’s Fluent design, and they can do it as the own pace, modernizing their apps as needed, just adding the pieces of UWP XAML that they need.

### 1PM – 2PM | Introduction to Xamarin.Forms for the XAML developer

Interested in building mobile apps for iOS and Android? Come see how to leverage your existing .NET and XAML skills to build beautiful native mobile apps with Xamarin inside of Visual Studio! James Montemagno will walk us through what Xamarin is, how to build apps with XAML, and how to access native features all from C#.

### 2PM – 3PM | DevOps for Desktop Applications

Client applications have unique requirements for DevOps, this session will show you how to use Azure to deploy MSIX based applications in an efficient and secure way. We will cover branching strategies, versioning, packaging and automatic deployment using Visual Studio App Center and Azure Pipelines. Learn about what we have in store here, and help us help you by providing feedback on current and future plans.
